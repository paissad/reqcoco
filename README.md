# About

**ReqCoCo** is a set of tools which helps to generate reports of code coverage.

The reports can generated in different ways (console, html, pdf, xlsx, ...)

The source from which the reports are built is based from an XML source file.

Custom generators can be built by anyone in order to generate a standard input source. And then **ReqCoCo** can be used to generate the report in the
desired format/output.
